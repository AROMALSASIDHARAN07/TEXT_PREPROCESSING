## 📌 Text Preprocessing Steps Explained

### 1️⃣ Lowercasing  
Converts all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.

### 2️⃣ Tokenization  
Splits text into individual words or tokens.

### 3️⃣ Removing Stopwords  
Removes common words like *is, the, and* that do not add much meaning.

### 4️⃣ Stemming  
Reduces words to their root form (e.g., *running → run*).

### 5️⃣ Lemmatization  
Converts words to their meaningful base form using vocabulary (e.g., *better → good*).

### 6️⃣ Removing Punctuation & Special Characters  
Cleans unnecessary symbols from text data.
